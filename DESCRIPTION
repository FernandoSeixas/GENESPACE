Title: Gene-space alignments of whole-genome sequence data. 
Version: 0.2.1
Author: JT Lovell
Maintainer: JT Lovell <jlovell@hudsonalpha.org>
Description: Collinear blocks are formed from parsed BLAST results 
      and fed into MCScanX. These blocks are re-aligned and local
      pairwise matches are validated. The pairwise associations are
      concatenated across all genome to build multiple-sequence alignments
      that include both annotated and unannotated gene sequence variation.
